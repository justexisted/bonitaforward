# Step 17: Business Accounts Section Extraction - 2025-10-19

## Summary
Successfully extracted the **Business Accounts** section from `Admin.tsx` into a dedicated component.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component Created
**File:** `src/components/admin/sections/BusinessAccountsSection-2025-10-19.tsx`

**Features:**
- Display of business accounts (profiles with `role === 'business'`)
- Expandable business details view
- Delete user functionality with confirmation and warning
- Loading states for detail fetching
- Clean TypeScript interfaces

**Props:**
- `profiles` - Array of user profiles
- `expandedBusinessDetails` - Object tracking expanded details state
- `loadingBusinessDetails` - Object tracking loading states
- `deletingUserId` - Currently deleting user ID (for confirmation)
- `onSetDeletingUserId` - Set user ID for deletion confirmation
- `onFetchBusinessDetails` - Fetch business details for a user
- `onCollapseBusinessDetails` - Collapse expanded details
- `onDeleteUser` - Delete a user account

### 2. Admin.tsx Integration
**Changes:**
- Added import for `BusinessAccountsSection`
- Replaced inline business accounts section (lines 2314-2414, ~100 lines) with the component
- Passed all necessary props to the component

**Props passed:**
```typescript
<BusinessAccountsSection
  profiles={profiles}
  expandedBusinessDetails={expandedBusinessDetails}
  loadingBusinessDetails={loadingBusinessDetails}
  deletingUserId={deletingUserId}
  onSetDeletingUserId={setDeletingUserId}
  onFetchBusinessDetails={fetchBusinessDetails}
  onCollapseBusinessDetails={collapseBusinessDetails}
  onDeleteUser={deleteUser}
/>
```

## Admin.tsx Size Reduction
- **Before:** ~3,857 lines
- **After:** ~3,758 lines
- **Lines extracted:** ~100 lines

## Testing Checklist
