# Coupon System Restoration - Complete Implementation

## Issue
The complete coupon system was missing from the admin panel. The database had all the proper fields (`coupon_code`, `coupon_discount`, `coupon_description`, `coupon_expires_at`), but they were not:
- In the TypeScript type definitions
- In the database queries
- In the save operations
- In the UI form

## Database Schema (Already Exists)
The following fields exist in the `providers` table:
- `coupon_code` TEXT - The coupon code (e.g., "SAVE20", "WELCOME10")
- `coupon_discount` TEXT - The discount description (e.g., "20% Off", "$50 Off", "Free Consultation")
- `coupon_description` TEXT - Additional details about the coupon offer
- `coupon_expires_at` TIMESTAMPTZ - When the coupon expires (optional)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Coupon Fields to TypeScript Type (ProviderRow)
```typescript
// Coupon system fields
coupon_code?: string | null
coupon_discount?: string | null
coupon_description?: string | null
coupon_expires_at?: string | null
```

### 2. Updated All Database SELECT Queries
Added coupon fields to all three locations where provider data is loaded:
- **Initial page load** (line ~1602): Added fields to query when admin page first loads
- **Post-save refresh** (line ~2128): Added fields to refresh query after saving provider
- **Post-delete refresh** (line ~2349): Added fields to refresh query after deleting provider

All SELECT statements now include:
```sql
coupon_code, coupon_discount, coupon_description, coupon_expires_at
```

### 3. Updated Save Operation
Added coupon fields to the `updateData` object in the `saveProvider` function (line ~2065):
```typescript
// Coupon system fields
coupon_code: p.coupon_code || null,
coupon_discount: p.coupon_discount || null,
coupon_description: p.coupon_description || null,
coupon_expires_at: p.coupon_expires_at || null,
```

### 4. Added Complete Coupon UI Form
Added a comprehensive coupon system section in the provider edit form (after Bonita Residents Discount, line ~4511):

#### Features:
- **Feature-gated** - Only available for Featured members (`is_member` flag)
- **Four input fields:**
  1. **Coupon Code** - Text input that auto-converts to uppercase, monospace font
  2. **Discount Amount/Type** - Text input for describing the discount
  3. **Expiration Date** - DateTime picker (optional)
  4. **Coupon Description** - Textarea for additional details

- **Live Preview** - Shows a styled coupon preview with:
  - Coupon code in large, bold monospace font
  - Discount amount in green
  - Description text
  - Expiration date (if set) in red
  - Coupon emoji (üéüÔ∏è) for visual appeal
  - Gradient background with dashed border

- **User Experience:**
  - Helper text under each field
  - Disabled state for non-featured accounts
  - Visual warning for non-featured accounts
  - Real-time preview updates as you type
  - Professional styling matching the rest of the admin panel

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx` - Complete coupon system implementation

## How to Use

### For Featured Accounts:
1. Open the admin panel and select a provider with Featured membership (`is_member = true`)
2. Scroll to the "Coupon System" section
3. Fill in the coupon details:
   - **Coupon Code**: Enter a memorable code (e.g., "SAVE20")
   - **Discount Amount/Type**: Describe the discount (e.g., "20% Off First Service")
   - **Expiration Date** (optional): Set when the coupon expires
   - **Coupon Description**: Add terms, conditions, or additional details
4. See the live preview of how the coupon will appear
5. Click "Save Changes" to persist the coupon to the database
6. Reload the provider to verify all fields are saved and loaded correctly

### For Non-Featured Accounts:
- The coupon section is visible but disabled
- Shows an upgrade message: "Upgrade to Featured to create exclusive coupon codes for your customers"
- All input fields are grayed out

## Expected Behavior After Implementation
1. ‚úÖ Create a new coupon with all fields
2. ‚úÖ Edit existing coupon fields
3. ‚úÖ Clear coupon fields (delete coupon)
4. ‚úÖ Set expiration date with time
5. ‚úÖ View live preview of coupon as you type
6. ‚úÖ All fields persist after saving
7. ‚úÖ All fields load correctly when reopening provider
8. ‚úÖ Feature-gating works (only Featured accounts can use it)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new coupon with all fields filled
- [ ] Save and verify fields persist
- [ ] Edit existing coupon and save
- [ ] Clear coupon fields and save (should remove coupon)
- [ ] Set expiration date and verify it saves correctly
- [ ] Open provider after page refresh to confirm persistence
- [ ] Try with non-featured account (should be disabled)
- [ ] Verify coupon preview updates in real-time
- [ ] Check that coupon code converts to uppercase automatically

## Notes
- Coupon code automatically converts to uppercase for consistency
- Expiration date uses browser's native datetime picker
- Preview only shows when coupon code is present
- All fields are optional except coupon code (for meaningful coupons)
- Uses the same state management pattern as other provider fields
