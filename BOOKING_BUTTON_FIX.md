# Booking Button Display Fix

## Issue Identified

The "Book Appointment" button was not appearing on the provider page even when the "Integrated Calendar Booking" option was enabled in the business settings.

## Root Cause

The booking button display logic had a flaw in how it handled the `booking_url` field:

**Before:**
```typescript
{provider.booking_url ? (
  // Show external "Book Now" button
) : (
  // Show integrated calendar booking button (only if enable_calendar_booking is true)
)}
```

**Problem:** If `booking_url` was an empty string (`""`) or contained only whitespace, JavaScript's truthy evaluation would still consider it "truthy", causing the system to show the external booking path instead of the integrated calendar booking button.

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Improved booking_url Check**
```typescript
// Before
{provider.booking_url ? (

// After  
{provider.booking_url && provider.booking_url.trim() ? (
```

**Result:** Now only shows external booking if there's an actual URL with content.

### 2. **Added Debug Information**
Temporarily added debug info to help diagnose the issue:
```typescript
<div className="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-2 p-2 bg-gray-100 rounded">
  Debug: booking_url="{provider.booking_url}", enable_calendar_booking={String(provider.enable_calendar_booking)}, booking_enabled={String(provider.booking_enabled)}
</div>
```

This will show the actual values on the provider page to help verify the fix is working.

## Expected Behavior Now

### **When Integrated Calendar Booking is Enabled:**
1. ✅ **Booking Section Shows**: "Book with [Business Name]" section appears
2. ✅ **Title Shows**: "Make a Reservation" (based on booking_type)
3. ✅ **Debug Info Shows**: Current values for booking_url, enable_calendar_booking, booking_enabled
4. ✅ **Book Appointment Button**: Blue button appears with calendar icon
5. ✅ **Button Click**: Opens booking modal for appointment scheduling

### **Booking Button Logic:**
- **External URL Present**: Shows "Book Now" button (external link)
- **No External URL + Calendar Enabled**: Shows "Book Appointment" button (integrated)
- **No External URL + Calendar Disabled**: Shows only contact methods (phone/email)

## Testing Steps

1. **Enable Integrated Calendar Booking** in `/my-business` edit form
2. **Save Changes** (should get "All changes applied immediately!" message)
3. **Visit Provider Page** `/provider/thai-restaurant`
4. **Check Booking Section**:
   - Should see "Book with Thai Restaurant" section
   - Should see "Make a Reservation" title
   - Should see debug info showing current values
   - Should see blue "Book Appointment" button
5. **Click Button**: Should open booking modal

## Debug Information

The debug info will show:
- `booking_url`: Should be empty or null if using integrated booking
- `enable_calendar_booking`: Should be `true` if enabled
- `booking_enabled`: Should be `true` if booking is enabled

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Fix**: Visit your restaurant page to see if the button appears
2. **Verify Debug Info**: Check the debug values to confirm they're correct
3. **Remove Debug Info**: Once confirmed working, the debug section can be removed
4. **Test Booking Flow**: Try clicking the button to ensure the booking modal works

The booking button should now appear correctly when you have Integrated Calendar Booking enabled!
