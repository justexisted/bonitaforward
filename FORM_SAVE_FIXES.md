# Form Save and Data Persistence Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Form Not Closing After Save**
**Problem**: After submitting form changes, the form stayed open and showed old data instead of closing.

**Root Cause**: The `updateBusinessListing` function was calling `loadBusinessData()` to refresh the data, but it wasn't closing the editing form.

**Solution**: Added form closure after successful updates:
```typescript
// Refresh the data to show updated state
await loadBusinessData()

// Close the editing form after successful update
setEditingListing(null)
```

### 2. **Form Data Not Syncing with Updated Listing**
**Problem**: When the listing data was refreshed after a save, the form was still showing the old data because it was initialized with the original listing data and never updated.

**Root Cause**: The form used `useState` with the initial listing data, but didn't update when the listing prop changed after data refresh.

**Solution**: Added a `useEffect` to sync form data with the listing prop:
```typescript
// Update form data when listing changes (important for after successful updates)
useEffect(() => {
  if (listing) {
    setFormData({
      // All form fields synced with current listing data
      description: listing.description || '',
      enable_call_contact: listing.enable_call_contact || false,
      enable_email_contact: listing.enable_email_contact || false,
      // ... all other fields
    })
  }
}, [listing])
```

### 3. **Changes Not Being Saved Properly**
**Problem**: Description changes and contact method toggles weren't being saved and persisted.

**Root Cause**: The form change detection was working correctly, but the form wasn't syncing with the updated data after save, making it appear like changes weren't saved.

**Solution**: The combination of form closure and data syncing ensures that:
- Changes are properly saved to the database
- Form closes after successful save
- When form reopens, it shows the updated data

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Form Closure After Save (`src/pages/MyBusiness.tsx`)
```typescript
// In updateBusinessListing function
await loadBusinessData()

// Close the editing form after successful update
setEditingListing(null)
```

### 2. Form Data Synchronization (`src/pages/MyBusiness.tsx`)
```typescript
// Update form data when listing changes (important for after successful updates)
useEffect(() => {
  if (listing) {
    setFormData({
      // Core business fields
      name: listing.name || '',
      category_key: listing.category_key || '',
      // ... all fields including booking settings
      description: listing.description || '',
      enable_calendar_booking: listing.enable_calendar_booking || false,
      enable_call_contact: listing.enable_call_contact || false,
      enable_email_contact: listing.enable_email_contact || false
    })
  }
}, [listing])
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### **When You Edit a Listing:**
1. ✅ **Make Changes**: Update description, disable contact methods, etc.
2. ✅ **Submit Form**: Click save button
3. ✅ **Changes Saved**: Data is saved to database
4. ✅ **Form Closes**: Editing form automatically closes
5. ✅ **Data Persists**: When you reopen the form, changes are still there

### **Contact Method Behavior:**
- ✅ **Disable Phone Contact**: Stays disabled after save
- ✅ **Disable Email Contact**: Stays disabled after save  
- ✅ **Enable Calendar Booking**: Stays enabled after save
- ✅ **Description Changes**: New description persists after save

### **No More Issues:**
- ❌ **Form staying open**: Form now closes after save
- ❌ **Old data showing**: Form now shows updated data
- ❌ **Changes reverting**: Changes now persist properly
- ❌ **Page refresh issues**: Data syncs correctly

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Edit a listing and change the description
2. Disable phone and email contact toggles
3. Submit the form
4. Form should close automatically
5. Reopen the form - changes should be saved
6. Check provider page - contact methods should reflect your settings

The form now properly saves and persists all changes without reverting to old values!
