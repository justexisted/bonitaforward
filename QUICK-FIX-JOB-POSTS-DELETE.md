# üö® Quick Fix: Job Posts Delete 403 Error

**Issue:** Getting `403 Forbidden` when trying to delete job posts  
**Cause:** Missing or incorrect RLS (Row Level Security) policy on `provider_job_posts` table  
**Solution:** Run the SQL script below in Supabase

---

## üéØ Quick Fix (Copy & Paste This)

**Go to:** [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí SQL Editor

**Paste and Run:**

```sql
-- QUICK FIX: Drop conflicting policies and create correct ones

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "delete_own_jobs" ON public.provider_job_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners can delete their own job posts" ON public.provider_job_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own job posts" ON public.provider_job_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business owners can delete their job posts" ON public.provider_job_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to delete their own job posts" ON public.provider_job_posts;

-- Enable RLS (in case it's disabled)
ALTER TABLE public.provider_job_posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create DELETE policy (THIS FIXES THE 403 ERROR)
CREATE POLICY "delete_own_jobs" 
ON public.provider_job_posts
FOR DELETE
USING (owner_user_id = auth.uid());

-- Verify it was created
SELECT 
  policyname,
  cmd as operation
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename = 'provider_job_posts'
  AND cmd = 'DELETE';
```

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

After running the SQL above, you should see:

```
policyname      | operation
----------------+-----------
delete_own_jobs | DELETE
```

---

## üß™ Test It

1. **Refresh your browser page** (to get a new auth token)
2. Try deleting a job post again
3. It should work now! ‚úÖ

---

## üîç If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Are you authenticated?
```sql
SELECT auth.uid() as my_user_id;
```
Should return your user ID (not null)

### Check 2: Do you own the job post?
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  owner_user_id,
  auth.uid() as my_user_id,
  (owner_user_id = auth.uid()) as i_own_this
FROM provider_job_posts
WHERE id = 'YOUR-JOB-POST-ID';
```
The `i_own_this` column should be `true`

### Check 3: Is RLS enabled?
```sql
SELECT 
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename = 'provider_job_posts';
```
Should return `true`

## üõ†Ô∏è Full Fix (If Quick Fix Doesn't Work)

If the quick fix above doesn't work, run the comprehensive fix:

**File:** `FIX-JOB-POSTS-DELETE-2025-10-28.sql`

This file drops **all** possible policy names and creates a clean set of policies.

---

## üìö Technical Details

### The Problem
The RLS policy for DELETE was either:
1. ‚ùå Missing entirely
2. ‚ùå Named incorrectly (so it wasn't being applied)
3. ‚ùå Had wrong logic (not checking `owner_user_id = auth.uid()`)

### The Solution
Created a DELETE policy that allows users to delete job posts where:
- `owner_user_id` (the job post's owner) equals `auth.uid()` (the current user)

This is the standard pattern for "users can delete their own data" in Supabase.

---

## üéØ Other Operations

While fixing DELETE, you might as well ensure these work too:

```sql
-- SELECT: View your own job posts
CREATE POLICY "select_own_jobs" 
ON public.provider_job_posts
FOR SELECT
USING (owner_user_id = auth.uid());

-- UPDATE: Edit your own job posts
CREATE POLICY "update_own_jobs" 
ON public.provider_job_posts
FOR UPDATE
USING (owner_user_id = auth.uid());

-- INSERT: Create new job posts
CREATE POLICY "insert_jobs" 
ON public.provider_job_posts
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (owner_user_id = auth.uid());
```

---

## üîê Security Note

This fix follows the **principle of least privilege**:
- ‚úÖ Users can only delete their **own** job posts
- ‚úÖ Users cannot delete other users' job posts
- ‚úÖ Admins (if configured) can still manage all job posts

---

## üí° Pro Tip

After fixing, **clear your browser cache** or do a hard refresh:
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

This ensures your browser gets a fresh auth token with the new permissions.

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

After running the SQL fix and refreshing your page, you should be able to delete job posts without any 403 errors!
