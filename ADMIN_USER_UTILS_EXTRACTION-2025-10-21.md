  - Contains all user-related administrative functions
  - Properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
  - Includes comprehensive documentation

### Functions Extracted

1. **`deleteUser()`** - Delete a user and all associated data
   - Calls Netlify function with authentication
   - Removes user from profiles, funnels, and bookings
   - Updates UI state immediately after deletion
   - Handles error cases gracefully

- Maintained all existing functionality
- No breaking changes to component API

### Code Quality
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All functions properly typed
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation included
- ✅ Error handling preserved

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: User management logic centralized
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Functions can be tested and updated independently
3. **Improved Readability**: Admin.tsx is more focused on UI and state management
4. **Code Reusability**: Utilities can be used by other admin components

## Next Steps
Continue extracting functions from Admin.tsx:
- Business application functions (approveApplication, deleteApplication)
- Data loading functions (loadChangeRequests, loadJobPosts, loadBookingEvents)
- Utility functions (normalizeEmail, normalizeRole)
- State management helpers (clearSavedState, startCreateNewProvider, etc.)

## Total Progress
- **Starting line count**: 2,008 lines
- **Current line count**: 1,715 lines
- **Lines extracted so far**: 293 lines
- **Percentage reduction**: 14.6%
