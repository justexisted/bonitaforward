# Step 20: Bookings Section Extraction - 2025-10-19

## Summary
Successfully extracted the **Bookings** section from `Admin.tsx` into a dedicated component.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component Created
**File:** `src/components/admin/sections/BookingsSection-2025-10-19.tsx`

**Features:**
- Display of bookings with editable fields
- Name, notes, and status editing
- Optional answers JSON editing
- Save and delete functionality
- Local state management for edits

**Props:**
- `bookings` - Array of booking data
- `onMessage` - Callback for success messages
- `onError` - Callback for error messages
- `onBookingsUpdate` - Callback to update bookings after deletion

**Local State:**
- `editBooking` - Object tracking edited fields per booking ID (name, notes, answers, status)

**Key Features:**
1. Editable name input field
2. Editable notes textarea
3. Optional answers JSON textarea (only shown if booking has answers)
4. Status dropdown (new, in_progress, closed)
5. Save button to update booking
6. Delete button to remove booking

### 2. Admin.tsx Integration
**Changes:**
- Added import for `BookingsSection`
- Replaced inline bookings section (lines 2333-2357, ~25 lines) with the component
- Removed unused state variable:
  - `editBooking` and `setEditBooking`
- Added comment marker for removed code (STEP 20)

**Props passed:**
```typescript
<BookingsSection
  bookings={bookings}
  onMessage={setMessage}
  onError={setError}
  onBookingsUpdate={setBookings}
/>
```

## Admin.tsx Size Reduction
- **Before:** ~3,556 lines
- **After:** ~3,532 lines
- **Lines extracted:** ~25 lines

## Component Architecture
The component is very similar to `FunnelResponsesSection`, following the same pattern:
1. Manage local edit state for user input
2. Parse JSON from textarea when saving
3. Handle save/delete with proper error handling
4. Update parent state via callbacks

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Bookings section loads correctly
- [ ] Name field is editable
- [ ] Notes field is editable
- [ ] Answers JSON textarea appears when booking has answers
- [ ] Answers JSON textarea is editable
- [ ] Status dropdown works correctly
- [ ] Save button updates booking
- [ ] Delete button removes booking
- [ ] Empty state displays correctly
- [ ] Error messages display correctly
- [ ] Success messages display correctly

## Notes
- No TypeScript errors introduced
- Component follows the same pattern as FunnelResponsesSection
- State now managed locally in component (edit state)
- Parent only maintains the source data (bookings array)
- No business logic changed, only extracted
- JSON parsing has error handling to prevent crashes

## Next Steps
Continue extracting remaining sections:
- ✅ Bookings (just completed)
- ⏳ Booking Events (~200 lines) - larger section with complex UI
- ⏳ Business Applications (~100 lines)
- ⏳ Providers (very large, ~1000+ lines) - will need careful breakdown
