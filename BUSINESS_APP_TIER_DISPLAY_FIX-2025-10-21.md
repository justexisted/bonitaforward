# Business Application Tier Display Fix - October 21, 2025

## CRITICAL BUG FIXED

### Issue Report
**CRITICAL**: Admin could NOT see what tier a business requested (free vs featured). This caused:
- Confusion about whether payment was required
- Risk of approving featured tier without collecting payment
- Risk of treating free applications as paid applications
- Complete lack of transparency in the application review process

### Root Cause
The `BusinessApplicationsSection` component was **NOT displaying the `tier_requested` field at all**.

The field exists in the database (`tier_requested: 'free' | 'featured'`), but it was completely hidden from the admin interface.

### What Was Broken
```typescript
// BEFORE - NO TIER INFORMATION SHOWN
<div className="rounded-xl border border-neutral-200 p-4 bg-neutral-50">
  <div className="font-medium text-neutral-900 text-lg">
    {app.business_name}
  </div>
  // ‚ùå No indication of free vs featured
  // ‚ùå No pricing information
  // ‚ùå Admin has no idea what tier was requested
</div>
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Prominent Tier Badge
Added large, color-coded badge at the top of each application:

**For FREE tier:**
```
üÜì FREE TIER REQUESTED (NO PAYMENT)
```
- Green badge with green border
- Clear "NO PAYMENT" message

**For FEATURED tier:**
```
‚≠ê FEATURED TIER REQUESTED ($97/YEAR)
```
- Yellow badge with yellow border
- Clear pricing shown

### 2. Color-Coded Cards
- **FREE applications**: White background with GREEN border
- **FEATURED applications**: YELLOW background with YELLOW border

### 3. Detailed Information Panels

**For FREE applications:**
```
üÜì FREE TIER APPLICATION
‚úÖ No payment required. This is a standard free listing request.
```

**For FEATURED applications:**
```
‚≠ê FEATURED TIER APPLICATION ‚≠ê
üí∞ PRICING: $97/year (PAYMENT REQUIRED)

What They Get:
- Priority placement in search results
- Enhanced business description
- Multiple images support
- Social media integration
- Booking system
- Analytics and insights

‚ö†Ô∏è COLLECT PAYMENT BEFORE ACTIVATING FEATURED STATUS
```

### 4. Debug Information
Shows raw `tier_requested` value for verification:
```
tier_requested=featured
tier_requested=free
tier_requested=null
```

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- `src/components/admin/sections/BusinessApplicationsSection-2025-10-19.tsx`

### Key Improvements
1. **Impossible to Miss**: Tier badge is first thing you see
2. **Color Coding**: Yellow = money, Green = free
3. **Clear Pricing**: Shows $97/year for featured
4. **Payment Warning**: Red warning to collect payment before approval

6. **Visual Separation**: Different colored borders and backgrounds

## Benefits
