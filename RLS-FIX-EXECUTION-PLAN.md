# RLS Fix - Execution Plan
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Goal:** End the RLS hell forever  
**Time Needed:** ~2-3 hours total

---

## üéØ WHAT WE'RE DOING

We're replacing **16+ scattered SQL fix files** with **1 master file** that's the single source of truth for ALL RLS policies.

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: Run the Audit (10 minutes)

**File:** `01-AUDIT-CURRENT-RLS-STATE.sql`

**Action:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Paste the entire contents of `01-AUDIT-CURRENT-RLS-STATE.sql`
3. Click Run
4. **Save the results** - you'll need them for the next step

**What to look for:**
- Which tables have RLS enabled
- Which tables are missing DELETE policies
- How many policies each table has
- Any tables without RLS at all (security risk!)

**Output:** A complete picture of your current RLS mess

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 2: I'll Create the Master File (30 minutes)

Based on your audit results, I'll create `02-MASTER-RLS-POLICIES.sql` that:

1. **Drops ALL existing policies** (clean slate)
2. **Creates consistent policies** for every table
3. **Uses naming convention:** `{table}_{operation}_{who}`
4. **Includes comments** explaining each policy
5. **Is idempotent** (safe to run multiple times)

**Tables to cover:**
- `providers`
- `provider_job_posts` (your current problem!)
- `provider_change_requests`
- `business_applications`
- `calendar_events`
- `booking_events`
- `bookings`
- `user_notifications`
- `funnel_responses`
- `contact_leads`
- Any other tables from your audit

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 3: Test in Staging (30 minutes)

**I'll create:** `03-TEST-RLS-POLICIES.sql`

**You'll run it to verify:**
- ‚úÖ SELECT queries work for public data
- ‚úÖ INSERT works for authenticated users
- ‚úÖ UPDATE works for owners
- ‚úÖ DELETE works for owners (fixes your current issue!)
- ‚úÖ Admin users can access everything
- ‚úÖ Users can't access other users' data

**If any test fails:** We fix the master file and test again (NOT create a new fix file!)

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 4: Deploy to Production (15 minutes)

Once tests pass:

1. **Backup your database** (just in case)
   ```sql
   -- Supabase auto-backups, but good to verify
   ```

2. **Run the master file**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
   # Paste 02-MASTER-RLS-POLICIES.sql
   # Run it
   ```

3. **Verify in your app**
   - Try deleting a job post (should work now!)
   - Try all CRUD operations
   - Check admin panel

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 5: Cleanup (15 minutes)

**Move old files to archive:**
```bash
mkdir archive/old-rls-fixes
mv FIX-*.sql archive/old-rls-fixes/
mv fix-*.sql archive/old-rls-fixes/
mv URGENT-*.sql archive/old-rls-fixes/
mv PROPER-*.sql archive/old-rls-fixes/
# etc.
```

**Keep only:**
- `01-AUDIT-CURRENT-RLS-STATE.sql` (for future audits)
- `02-MASTER-RLS-POLICIES.sql` (the single source of truth)
- `03-TEST-RLS-POLICIES.sql` (for testing)

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 6: Document (15 minutes)

**I'll create:** `RLS-POLICY-REFERENCE.md`

This will document:
- Security model for each table
- What each policy does
- Common issues and solutions
- How to add policies for new tables

---

## üîÑ NEW WORKFLOW (Going Forward)

### Adding a New Table:
```
1. Create table in migration
2. Add policies to 02-MASTER-RLS-POLICIES.sql
3. Add tests to 03-TEST-RLS-POLICIES.sql
4. Run tests
5. If pass, deploy
6. Update RLS-POLICY-REFERENCE.md
```

### Getting an RLS Error:
```
1. DON'T create fix-rls-X.sql ‚ùå
2. Update 02-MASTER-RLS-POLICIES.sql ‚úÖ
3. Run 03-TEST-RLS-POLICIES.sql
4. If pass, deploy
```

### Changing Permissions:
```
1. Update 02-MASTER-RLS-POLICIES.sql
2. Run tests
3. If pass, deploy
4. Update docs
```

---

## üéì WHY THIS WORKS

### The Old Problem:
```
Day 1: Create fix-rls-1.sql ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí works
Day 2: Create fix-rls-2.sql ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí conflicts with fix-rls-1.sql ‚Üí breaks
Day 3: Create urgent-fix-rls.sql ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí conflicts with both ‚Üí more breaks
Day 4: Create proper-fix-rls.sql ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí you get the idea...
```

**Result:** 16 files, all conflicting, nothing working consistently.

### The New Solution:
```
Day 1: Update master file ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí works
Day 2: Update master file ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí works
Day 3: Update master file ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí works
Forever: Update master file ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí works
```

**Result:** 1 file, no conflicts, everything works consistently.

---

## üîë KEY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Single Source of Truth
**One file** defines **all policies** for **all tables**.

No more hunting through 16 files to understand the security model.

### 2. Drop Before Create
Every time we run the master file, we:
1. Drop ALL existing policies
2. Create fresh policies from scratch

**Result:** No conflicts, no stale policies, no confusion.

### 3. Test Before Deploy
We **never** deploy without testing.

**Result:** Catch errors before users do.

### 4. Document Everything
Every policy has a comment explaining what it does.

**Result:** Team understands the security model.

### 5. Consistent Naming
Format: `{table}_{operation}_{who}`

Examples:
- `providers_select_public` - anyone can view published providers
- `providers_delete_owner` - owners can delete their providers
- `providers_update_admin` - admins can update any provider

**Result:** Easy to understand what each policy does.

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE FIX (While We Build the Master File)

For your current job posts delete issue:

```sql
-- Quick fix for right now
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "delete_own_jobs" ON public.provider_job_posts;

CREATE POLICY "delete_own_jobs" 
ON public.provider_job_posts
FOR DELETE
USING (owner_user_id = auth.uid());
```

Run this now, then we'll integrate it into the master file.

---

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

After implementing this:

### Quantitative:
- ‚úÖ **1 master file** instead of 16+ fix files
- ‚úÖ **0 RLS errors** in production
- ‚úÖ **100% test coverage** for policies
- ‚úÖ **<5 minutes** to add policies for new table

### Qualitative:
- ‚úÖ **No more frustration** with daily RLS errors
- ‚úÖ **Confidence** when deploying (tests passed = it works)
- ‚úÖ **Speed** when adding features (clear process)
- ‚úÖ **Understanding** of security model (documented)

---

## ‚è∞ TIMELINE

### This Week:
- **Today:** Run audit, create master file, test
- **Tomorrow:** Deploy to production, verify
- **This Week:** Cleanup old files, document

### Next Week:
- Use new process for any changes
- Monitor for issues (should be zero!)
- Celebrate RLS hell ending üéâ

---

## üÜò IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### Don't Panic! Here's the rollback:
```sql
-- Disable RLS temporarily (nuclear option)
ALTER TABLE problem_table DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Check what broke
SELECT * FROM problem_table; -- should work now

-- Fix the master file
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE problem_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Run master file again
```

### Get Help:
1. Share the audit output
2. Share the error message
3. Share what operation failed
4. I'll help fix the master file

---

## üí™ COMMITMENT

From now on, we follow this rule:

**If you need to change RLS:**
1. ‚úÖ Update `02-MASTER-RLS-POLICIES.sql`
2. ‚úÖ Run `03-TEST-RLS-POLICIES.sql`
3. ‚úÖ Deploy if tests pass

**Never:**
1. ‚ùå Create a new fix-rls-X.sql file
2. ‚ùå Deploy without testing
3. ‚ùå Make RLS changes in multiple files

---

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Right now, run this to fix your job posts:**

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "delete_own_jobs" ON public.provider_job_posts;

CREATE POLICY "delete_own_jobs" 
ON public.provider_job_posts
FOR DELETE
USING (owner_user_id = auth.uid());
```

**Then, share your audit results so I can build the master file for your specific setup.**

---

## üéâ THE END GOAL

By the end of this, you'll have:

1. ‚úÖ Clean, working RLS on all tables
2. ‚úÖ One master file that's easy to maintain
3. ‚úÖ Automated tests to prevent errors
4. ‚úÖ Clear documentation
5. ‚úÖ No more daily RLS frustrations

**No more RLS hell. Just clean, predictable security.**
