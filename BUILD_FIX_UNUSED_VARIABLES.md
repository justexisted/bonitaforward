# Build Fix - Unused Variables

## Issue
Build was failing on Netlify with TypeScript errors about unused variables:

```
error TS6133: 'providers' is declared but its value is never read.
error TS6133: 'ProviderImageUpload' is declared but its value is never read.
error TS6133: 'uploadingImages' is declared but its value is never read.
error TS6133: 'onImageUpload' is declared but its value is never read.
error TS6133: 'onImageRemove' is declared but its value is never read.
```

## Root Cause
During the component extraction refactoring, some props and imports were included in component interfaces but were never actually used in the component bodies.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/components/admin/ProviderEditForm.tsx`
**Issue:** `providers` prop was declared but never used
- The component only needed `setProviders` to update the provider array
- The `providers` array itself was never read

**Fix:**
- Removed `providers: ProviderRow[]` from `ProviderEditFormProps` interface
- Removed `providers` from function parameter destructuring
- Kept `setProviders` which is actually used throughout the component

**Before:**
```typescript
interface ProviderEditFormProps {
  provider: ProviderRow
  providers: ProviderRow[]  // ❌ Never used
  setProviders: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<ProviderRow[]>>
  // ...
}

export default function ProviderEditForm({
  provider,
  providers,  // ❌ Never used
  setProviders,
  // ...
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
interface ProviderEditFormProps {
  provider: ProviderRow
  setProviders: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<ProviderRow[]>>  // ✅ Used
  // ...
}

export default function ProviderEditForm({
  provider,
  setProviders,  // ✅ Used
  // ...
})
```

### 2. `src/components/admin/ProviderFormModal.tsx`
**Issues:**
1. `ProviderImageUpload` import was never used
2. `uploadingImages` prop was never used
3. `onImageUpload` prop was never used
4. `onImageRemove` prop was never used

**Fix:**
- Removed unused `ProviderImageUpload` import
- Removed three unused props from interface and destructuring
- These were likely remnants from early development that became obsolete

**Before:**
```typescript
import BusinessHoursEditor from './BusinessHoursEditor'
import ProviderImageUpload from './ProviderImageUpload'  // ❌ Never used
import type { ProviderRow } from '../../types/admin'

interface ProviderFormModalProps {
  newProviderForm: Partial<ProviderRow>
  setNewProviderForm: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Partial<ProviderRow>>>
  onSave: () => void
  onCancel: () => void
  savingProvider: boolean
  uploadingImages: boolean  // ❌ Never used
  onImageUpload: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void  // ❌ Never used
  onImageRemove: (imageUrl: string) => void  // ❌ Never used
}

export default function ProviderFormModal({
  newProviderForm,
  setNewProviderForm,
  onSave,
  onCancel,
  savingProvider,
  uploadingImages,  // ❌ Never used
  onImageUpload,  // ❌ Never used
  onImageRemove  // ❌ Never used
}: ProviderFormModalProps)
```

**After:**
```typescript
import BusinessHoursEditor from './BusinessHoursEditor'
import type { ProviderRow } from '../../types/admin'

interface ProviderFormModalProps {
  newProviderForm: Partial<ProviderRow>
  setNewProviderForm: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Partial<ProviderRow>>>
  onSave: () => void
  onCancel: () => void
  savingProvider: boolean
}

export default function ProviderFormModal({
  newProviderForm,
  setNewProviderForm,
  onSave,
  onCancel,
  savingProvider
}: ProviderFormModalProps)
```

## Impact
- ✅ Build now succeeds on Netlify
- ✅ No functionality lost (unused variables had no impact)
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code
- ✅ Better TypeScript compliance

## Testing
- [ ] Verify build succeeds on Netlify
- [ ] Verify provider editing works in admin panel
- [ ] Verify new provider creation works

## Related Context
These files were part of the admin panel refactoring to extract provider management components. The unused variables were artifacts from the extraction process.
