# Booking System Explained: 3 Different Tables

You have **three different booking/event-related tables**, each serving a different purpose:

---

## 1. 📅 `calendar_events` - Community Events

**Purpose:** Public community events that appear on the main calendar page

**Examples:**
- Farmers markets
- Community festivals  
- Public workshops
- Town hall meetings
- Holiday events

**Who Uses It:**
- ✅ Public can view
- ✅ Admin can create/edit
- ✅ NOT for customer bookings

**Columns:**
- `id`, `title`, `description`, `date`, `location`, `zip_code`
- `category`, `tags`, `image`, `url`

**URL:** `/calendar` page

## 2. 📋 `bookings` - Funnel Form Submissions

**Purpose:** Store customer interest/lead capture from your booking funnel

**What It Stores:**
- Customer contact info
- Which provider they're interested in
- When they want service
- What service they want
- Form submission data

**Examples:**
- "John Doe wants to book XYZ Plumbing for next Tuesday"

## 3. 📆 `booking_events` - Confirmed Appointments (Google Calendar Integration)

**Purpose:** Actual confirmed appointments synced with Google Calendar

**What It Stores:**
- Real appointments that are scheduled
- Google Calendar event IDs
- Booking status (confirmed/cancelled/completed)
- Exact date/time/duration

**Examples:**
- "Appointment confirmed: John Doe → XYZ Plumbing, Tuesday 2pm, 60 minutes"
- "Booking status: confirmed"

**Who Uses It:**
- ✅ Created when appointment is confirmed
- ✅ Synced with Google Calendar
- ✅ Admin should view ALL (❌ currently blocked by RLS)

**Columns:**

## Current Issue: `booking_events` RLS

### The Problem

You're seeing warnings because:
- ❌ `booking_events` table has NO admin access policy
- ⚠️ You can't see confirmed appointments
- ⚠️ Console shows: "ADMIN CANNOT ACCESS BOOKING EVENTS (RLS)"

### Why You Need Access

As admin, you need to see `booking_events` to:
- 📊 Monitor actual booking volume
- 🔍 Track confirmed appointments
- 🛠️ Help customers with booking issues
- 💰 Understand revenue/activity
- ✅ Verify Google Calendar sync

### The Fix

**Run this SQL in Supabase:**
1. Open `fix-booking-events-admin-access.sql` (already open)
2. Verify line 23 has your email: `'justexisted@gmail.com'`
3. Copy entire file
4. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
5. Paste and run
6. Refresh admin panel

---

## Summary Table

| Table | Purpose | Current Admin Access | Needs Fix? |
|-------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| **calendar_events** | Community events | ✅ Full access | No |
| **bookings** | Lead forms/requests | ✅ Full access | No |
| **booking_events** | Confirmed appointments | ❌ NO ACCESS | **YES** |

---

## Why The Warnings Won't Stop

You're seeing the warning because:
1. Code is trying to load `booking_events`
2. Database RLS policy blocks access
3. Code handles it gracefully (returns empty array)
4. Warning logged to console

**To stop the warnings:**
- Run the SQL fix in Supabase
- This adds admin RLS policy
- Admin can then see all booking events
- Warnings disappear

**Current impact:**
- ✅ Admin panel works fine
- ✅ Other data loads successfully
- ⚠️ Just can't see confirmed appointments
- ⚠️ Console warning (not breaking error)

---

## Quick Reference

**See community events?** → `calendar_events` ✅  
**See booking requests?** → `bookings` ✅  
**See confirmed appointments?** → `booking_events` ❌ ← FIX THIS

**Action Required:** Run SQL fix for `booking_events` admin access
