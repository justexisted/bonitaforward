# Featured Badge Display Fix

## Problem

On the restaurant booking page, some restaurants that should show the featured star badge weren't displaying it, while others were. This was causing inconsistency in how featured/member businesses were displayed.

## Root Cause

The issue was in how featured/member status was being determined from the database:

### 1. **Strict Type Checking**
The `coerceIsMember()` function in `providerService.ts` was using strict equality checks:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const isFeatured = r.is_featured === true
const isMember = r.is_member === true
```

This ONLY matched boolean `true` values, but PostgreSQL can return boolean fields as:
- `true` / `false` (boolean)
- `1` / `0` (number)  
- `'true'` / `'false'` (string)
- `null` / `undefined`

If the database returned `1` or `'true'`, the check would fail, and the restaurant wouldn't be marked as featured.

### 2. **Inconsistent Checks Across App**
Different parts of the app (Admin page, BookPage, ProviderPage) were using different logic to check featured status, leading to inconsistencies.

## Solution

### 1. **Created Shared Boolean Coercion Helper**

Added `coerceBoolean()` function in `src/utils/helpers.ts`:

```typescript
export function coerceBoolean(val: any): boolean {
  if (val === true || val === 1 || val === '1' || val === 'true') return true
  if (val === false || val === 0 || val === '0' || val === 'false') return false
  return false
}
```

This handles all possible boolean representations from PostgreSQL.

### 2. **Enhanced isFeaturedProvider() Function**

Updated `isFeaturedProvider()` in `src/utils/helpers.ts` to:
- Work with both processed Provider objects (with `isMember` field)
- Work with raw database records (with `is_member` / `is_featured` fields)
- Use the new `coerceBoolean()` helper for type safety

```typescript
export function isFeaturedProvider(provider: Provider | any): boolean {
  // Check processed isMember field first
  if ('isMember' in provider) {
    return Boolean(provider.isMember)
  }
  
  // Fall back to checking raw database fields with type coercion
  const isFeatured = coerceBoolean(provider.is_featured)
  const isMember = coerceBoolean(provider.is_member)
  
  return isFeatured || isMember
}
```

### 3. **Updated Provider Service**

Modified `coerceIsMember()` in `src/services/providerService.ts` to use the shared `coerceBoolean()` helper:

```typescript
function coerceIsMember(r: any): boolean {
  const isFeatured = coerceBoolean(r.is_featured)
  const isMember = coerceBoolean(r.is_member)
  return isFeatured || isMember
}
```

### 4. **Updated Admin Page**

Updated `src/pages/Admin.tsx` to use the shared `isFeaturedProvider()` function instead of strict checks:

```typescript
// BEFORE
providers.filter(provider => provider.is_featured === true || provider.is_member === true)

// AFTER
providers.filter(provider => isFeaturedProvider(provider))
```

## Files Changed

1. **src/utils/helpers.ts**
   - Added `coerceBoolean()` helper function
   - Enhanced `isFeaturedProvider()` to handle raw DB records

2. **src/services/providerService.ts**
   - Updated `coerceIsMember()` to use `coerceBoolean()`
   - Added import for `coerceBoolean`

3. **src/pages/Admin.tsx**
   - Added import for `isFeaturedProvider`
   - Updated filters to use `isFeaturedProvider()`
   - Updated featured count to use `isFeaturedProvider()`

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Visit booking page and verify ALL featured restaurants show the star badge
- [ ] Check admin page featured filter works correctly
- [ ] Verify provider detail pages show featured badge correctly
- [ ] Test with different database boolean value types (true, 1, '1', 'true')

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **ALL restaurants with:**
- `is_member = true/1/'1'/'true'` OR
- `is_featured = true/1/'1'/'true'`

Will now correctly display the "⭐ Featured" badge on:
- Booking page (top matches and other providers sections)
- Provider detail pages
- Admin page (with consistent filtering)

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Single source of truth for featured status checks
2. **Reliability**: Handles all PostgreSQL boolean representations
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized logic easier to update
4. **Type Safety**: Works with both typed and untyped data

## Related Issues

This fix also resolves any inconsistencies where:
- Admin page showed a provider as featured but the public page didn't
- Featured badge disappeared after database updates
- Some featured restaurants appeared at the bottom of lists
