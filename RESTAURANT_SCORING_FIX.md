# Restaurant Scoring Logic - Complete Fix

## Problem Summary

When visiting the booking page with restaurant filters, several critical issues caused incorrect behavior:

1. **Featured restaurants appeared at the bottom** instead of the top
2. **Price range filter didn't work** (wrong key name)
3. **Dietary filter was completely ignored**
4. **Missing restaurants** that should have appeared
5. **Tag value mismatches** (e.g., "budget" vs "$")

## Root Causes

### 1. Price Range Filter Key Mismatch ❌
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
const price = answers['price']?.toLowerCase()
```

The funnel question uses `'price-range'` as the ID, but the scoring function was looking for `'price'`. This meant the price range filter was **completely ignored**.

### 2. Dietary Filter Missing ❌
The dietary filter from the URL (`"dietary":"none"`) was never processed by the scoring function at all.

### 3. Featured Restaurant Logic Backwards ❌
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
// Only prioritize featured providers that match the cuisine
const am = aFeaturedMatchesCuisine ? 1 : 0
const bm = bFeaturedMatchesCuisine ? 1 : 0
if (bm !== am) return bm - am
```

This logic meant:
- Featured restaurants only got priority if they matched the selected cuisine
- If they didn't match, they got NO boost
- They ended up at the bottom based on their low score

### 4. Tag Value Mismatches ❌
Filter values like `"budget"`, `"moderate"` didn't match database tags like `"$"`, `"$$"`.

## Solutions Implemented ✅

### 1. Fixed Price Range Filter Key
```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT)
const priceRange = answers['price-range']?.toLowerCase() // FIXED: Was 'price'
```

### 2. Added Dietary Filter Support
```typescript
const dietary = answers['dietary']?.toLowerCase() // ADDED

// DIETARY MATCHING: Medium weight (important for restrictions)
if (dietary && dietary !== 'none') {
  // Check for exact match
  if (providerTags.some(t => t.toLowerCase() === dietary)) {
    score += 3
  } else {
    // Check for dietary synonyms
    const dietaryMatch = providerTags.some(t => {
      const tagLower = t.toLowerCase()
      return dietarySynonyms.some(synonym => 
        tagLower === synonym || 
        tagLower.includes(synonym)
      )
    })
    if (dietaryMatch) score += 2
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Price Range & Dietary Synonym Mapping
```typescript
function getPriceRangeSynonyms(priceRange: string): string[] {
  const synonyms: Record<string, string[]> = {
    'budget': ['budget', '$', 'budget-friendly', 'cheap', 'affordable', 'inexpensive'],
    'moderate': ['moderate', '$$', 'mid-range', 'reasonable'],
    'upscale': ['upscale', '$$$', 'expensive', 'high-end', 'premium'],
    'fine-dining': ['fine-dining', 'fine dining', '$$$$', 'luxury', 'exclusive', 'gourmet']
  }
  return synonyms[priceRange] || [priceRange]
}

function getDietarySynonyms(dietary: string): string[] {
  const synonyms: Record<string, string[]> = {
    'vegetarian': ['vegetarian', 'veggie', 'vegetarian options', 'vegetarian-friendly'],
    'vegan': ['vegan', 'plant-based', 'vegan options', 'vegan-friendly'],
    'gluten-free': ['gluten-free', 'gluten free', 'gf', 'celiac', 'gluten-free options'],
    'keto': ['keto', 'low-carb', 'ketogenic', 'keto-friendly', 'keto options'],
    'halal': ['halal', 'halal meat', 'halal certified'],
    'kosher': ['kosher', 'kosher certified']
  }
  return synonyms[dietary] || [dietary]
}
```

### 4. Fixed Featured Restaurant Priority Logic
```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT)
.sort((a, b) => {
  const aIsFeatured = isFeaturedProvider(a.p)
  const bIsFeatured = isFeaturedProvider(b.p)
  
  // Sort by score first (highest first)
  if (b.score !== a.score) return b.score - a.score
  
  // Within same score tier, featured goes first
  if (aIsFeatured !== bIsFeatured) return bIsFeatured ? 1 : -1
  
  // Then by rating (highest first)
  const ar = a.p.rating ?? 0
  const br = b.p.rating ?? 0
  if (br !== ar) return br - ar
  
  // Finally by name (alphabetical)
  return a.p.name.localeCompare(b.p.name)
})
```

**New behavior:**
- Sort by score first (best matches at top)
- Within same score tier, featured restaurants appear first
- Then by rating
- Then alphabetically

### 5. All Restaurants Now Show (Base Score)
```typescript
// Give all providers a base score so they all show up
score = 1
```

Every restaurant starts with a score of 1, ensuring all restaurants appear. Better matches just score higher.

## Scoring Weights

The new scoring system uses these weights:

| Filter | Exact Match | Synonym Match |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Cuisine** | +8 | +6 |
| **Occasion** | +4 | - |
| **Price Range** | +4 | +3 |
| **Service** | +3 | - |
| **Dietary** | +3 | +2 |
| **Base** | +1 | - |

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When visiting:
```
/book?category=restaurants-cafes&filters={"occasion":"casual","cuisine":"american","price-range":"budget","dietary":"none"}
```

**You should now see:**

1. ✅ **Top Matches Section:**
   - Restaurants matching "american" cuisine + "casual" + "budget" (highest scores)
   - Featured restaurants appear first within their score tier
   - Sorted by: score → featured status → rating → name

2. ✅ **Other Providers Section:**
   - All remaining restaurants (even if they don't match filters)
   - Still sorted by relevance score
   - Featured restaurants still prioritized within their score tier

3. ✅ **Featured Restaurant Position:**
   - Now appears at the TOP of its score tier
   - Not buried at the bottom

4. ✅ **All Filters Working:**
   - Cuisine ✓
   - Occasion ✓
   - Price Range ✓ (FIXED)
   - Dietary ✓ (FIXED)
