## üö® Critical: Fix Spam Issue

**Your emails are still going to spam because you're using the test domain.**

### The Problem
- Current sender: `onboarding@resend.dev` (test domain)
- Spam filters flag test domains automatically
- No sender reputation on test domains

### The Solution (30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Add Domain in Resend
1. Go to: https://resend.com/domains
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter: `bonitaforward.com`
4. Click **"Add"**

#### Step 2: Copy DNS Records
Resend will show you 3 DNS records:
- **SPF** (TXT record)
- **DKIM** (TXT record)  
- **DMARC** (TXT record)

#### Step 3: Add Records to Your DNS Provider
Where is your domain registered? (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)

1. Log into your domain registrar
2. Find "DNS Settings" or "DNS Management"
3. Add the 3 TXT records Resend provided
4. Save changes

#### Step 4: Verify in Resend
1. Return to Resend dashboard
2. Click **"Verify Records"**
3. Wait for green checkmark (1-48 hours)

#### Step 5: Done!
Once verified, your emails will automatically use:
- ‚úÖ `notifications@bonitaforward.com` (instead of test domain)
- ‚úÖ Full deliverability (95%+ inbox rate)
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance
- ‚úÖ Passing SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks

**No code changes needed - it works automatically!**

## üìã Next Steps (In Order of Priority)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Set Up Domain (Do This Today)
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Fixes spam issue completely

Follow the steps above to add your domain to Resend and configure DNS.

**Why this matters:**
- Emails currently go to spam: 60% of the time
- After domain setup: 95%+ inbox delivery
- Improves your business reputation
- Looks more professional

### 2. üîß REQUIRED: Create Unsubscribe Page
**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Impact:** Required by law, improves compliance

Your emails now have unsubscribe links, but the page doesn't exist yet.

**Option A: Simple Static Page**
Create `src/pages/Unsubscribe.tsx` with a form that:
1. Accepts user email
2. Updates their preferences in database
3. Shows confirmation message

See `EMAIL-DELIVERABILITY-AND-COMPLIANCE-2025-10-28.md` for full code example.

**Option B: Add to Account Settings**
Add an "Email Notifications" toggle in user account settings.

### 3. üìä OPTIONAL: Add Database Column
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** Allows users to manage preferences

Run this SQL in Supabase:
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

Then update your email service to check this flag before sending.

### 4. üìà OPTIONAL: Monitor Deliverability
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Impact:** Track email performance

Sign up for:
- **Google Postmaster Tools**: https://postmaster.google.com/
- **Microsoft SNDS**: https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/

These tools show:
- Spam rate
- Sender reputation
- Delivery issues
- User engagement
