## 📝 NOTES

### Helper Functions Extracted
Both components include reusable helper functions:
- `formatFieldName()` - Converts snake_case to Title Case
- `formatValue()` - Formats various value types for display
- `getRequestTypeName()` - Maps request types to display names
- `getStatusClasses()` - Returns Tailwind classes for status badges
- `getDecidedStatusText()` - Maps status to decision text

These could be further extracted to a shared utils file if needed across multiple components.

### Type Definitions
The notification type is defined as:
```typescript
type NotificationType = 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
```

This matches the function signatures in `MyBusiness.tsx` and ensures type safety.
