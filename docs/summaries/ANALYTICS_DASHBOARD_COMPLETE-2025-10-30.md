## 🔐 SECURITY & RLS

**All analytics data is protected by Row Level Security:**

✅ Business owners can **only see analytics for their own listings**  
✅ Admins can see analytics for **all listings**  
✅ Anonymous users **cannot access** analytics data  
✅ RLS policies verified and working (from Phase 2)

---

## 📊 ANALYTICS METRICS EXPLAINED

### **Views**
- Counted once per session per listing
- Prevents double-counting on page refresh
- Tracks anonymous + logged-in users

### **Clicks**
- Phone clicks: User clicks phone number
- Website clicks: User clicks "Visit Website"
- Each click creates new event

### **Saves**
- User bookmarks the listing
- Only tracked when user adds to favorites (not when removing)
- Requires authentication

### **Conversions**
- **Funnel Responses**: Leads from business funnel forms
- **Bookings**: Confirmed calendar bookings
- Combined for total conversion metric

### **Conversion Rate**
- Formula: `(Total Conversions / Total Views) × 100`
- Example: 5 conversions from 100 views = 5% conversion rate

---

## 🎨 UI/UX HIGHLIGHTS

### **Responsive Design**
- ✅ Mobile-first approach
- ✅ Grid layouts adjust to screen size
- ✅ Tables scroll horizontally on small screens
- ✅ Dropdowns stack vertically on mobile

### **Loading States**
- ✅ Spinner animation while loading
- ✅ "Loading analytics..." message
- ✅ Graceful error handling

### **Empty States**
- ✅ "No listings yet" state
- ✅ "No analytics data yet" state
- ✅ "No events recorded" state
- ✅ Each with helpful messaging and icons

### **Professional Design**
- ✅ Clean color palette (blue, green, purple, yellow)
- ✅ Gradient backgrounds for premium cards
- ✅ SVG icons (no emojis in main UI)
- ✅ Professional badges and pills
- ✅ Consistent spacing and typography

---

## 📈 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

1. **Parallel Data Loading**: All analytics API calls run in parallel
2. **Event Limit**: Table displays first 100 events only
3. **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side event filtering (no re-fetch)
4. **Lazy Loading**: Analytics service is dynamically imported
5. **Memoization**: React components use proper dependencies

---

## ⚠️ PENDING FEATURES

### **Export to CSV** (TODO)
Currently shows alert: "Export functionality coming soon!"

**Implementation plan:**
```typescript
// In AnalyticsTab.tsx (line 272)
const exportToCSV = () => {
  // Build CSV from events, funnelAttributions, bookingAttributions
  const csv = generateCSV(events, summary)
  downloadCSV(csv, `analytics-${selectedListing?.name}-${new Date().toISOString()}.csv`)
}
```

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes
