## Design Patterns Used

### Consistent Modal Structure
All modals follow the same design pattern:
```tsx
{showModal && data && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center z-50 p-4">
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl max-w-md w-full p-6">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-4">Title</h3>
      {/* Content */}
      <div className="flex gap-3">
        <button onClick={confirmAction} className="primary-action">Confirm</button>
        <button onClick={closeModal} className="secondary-action">Cancel</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### State Management
Each modal uses dedicated state:
- `showModal` - Boolean to control visibility
- `modalData` - Data for the item being edited/deleted
- Additional state for form fields (edit modals)

### Color Coding
- **Red buttons:** Destructive actions (delete, reject)
- **Blue buttons:** Primary actions (save, dismiss)
- **Gray buttons:** Cancel/secondary actions

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Contextual Information:** Modals show relevant details about what's being modified/deleted
2. **Visual Hierarchy:** Important information highlighted with bold text or colored backgrounds
3. **Clear Actions:** Button labels are explicit (e.g., "Delete Booking" not just "OK")
4. **Escape Hatches:** All modals have cancel buttons and can be closed
5. **Confirmation Safety:** Destructive actions require explicit button click (no Enter key traps)

## Benefits Over Native Popups

1. **Modern Design:** Consistent with the rest of the application UI
2. **Better UX:** More space for information and clearer action buttons
3. **Accessibility:** Better keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Flexibility:** Can show complex information (cards, multiple fields)
5. **Mobile Friendly:** Better responsive design compared to native popups
6. **Styling Control:** Full control over appearance and behavior
7. **No Browser Quirks:** Native popups look different across browsers

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test rejection flow with and without reason text
2. Test edit modals with empty/invalid data
3. Test all delete confirmations cancel properly
4. Test modals on mobile viewports
5. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
6. Verify no form submissions on Cancel
7. Test rapid clicking doesn't create issues

---

## Maintenance Notes

- All modal state follows the same pattern for consistency
- Modal styles use Tailwind CSS classes for easy maintenance
- State cleanup happens on both confirm and cancel actions
- No memory leaks - all state properly cleared after modal closes
