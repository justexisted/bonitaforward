# Persistent Notification Dismissal System

## Overview
Implemented a database-backed notification dismissal system that permanently tracks when users dismiss notifications until there's new activity. Notifications will only reappear when there are actual new changes since the last dismissal.

## Database Changes Required

### 1. Run the SQL Script
Execute the `create-notification-tracking-table.sql` script in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Create table to track dismissed notifications for users
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.dismissed_notifications (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  notification_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
  dismissed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_activity_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL, -- timestamp of the most recent activity when dismissed
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, notification_type)
);

-- Add RLS policies and indexes...
```

## How It Works

### 1. Notification Types Tracked
- **Pending**: Change requests waiting for admin approval
- **Approved**: Recently approved change requests (last 30 days)
- **Rejected**: Recently rejected change requests (last 30 days)

### 2. Dismissal Logic
When a user clicks the dismiss button (❌):
1. System captures the timestamp of the most recent activity for that notification type
2. Saves the dismissal to the database with the activity timestamp
3. Notification is hidden until new activity occurs

### 3. Re-display Logic
Notifications reappear when:
- **Pending**: New pending requests are created after dismissal timestamp
- **Approved**: New approvals happen after dismissal timestamp (within 30 days)
- **Rejected**: New rejections happen after dismissal timestamp (within 30 days)

### 4. Persistence
- Dismissals persist across browser sessions
- Dismissals persist across sign-in/sign-out cycles
- Dismissals persist across device changes
- Each user has independent dismissal tracking

## Implementation Details

### Database Functions Added
- `dismissNotification()` - Saves dismissal with activity timestamp
- `getDismissedNotifications()` - Retrieves user's dismissal history
- `getLatestActivityTimestamp()` - Gets most recent activity for notification type

### UI Changes
- Dismiss buttons (❌) on all top notifications
- Smart notification display based on new activity
- Persistent state across sessions

### User Experience
1. User sees notification for new activity
2. User clicks dismiss (❌) to hide notification
3. Notification stays hidden until new activity occurs
4. When new activity happens, notification reappears
5. Process repeats - user can dismiss again

## Benefits
- **No Spam**: Users won't see the same notifications repeatedly
- **New Activity Alerts**: Users are notified when genuinely new things happen
- **Persistent**: Works across all devices and sessions
- **Smart**: Only shows notifications for actual new activity
- **User Control**: Users can permanently dismiss until new activity

## Testing
1. Create a change request → should see pending notification
2. Dismiss notification → should disappear
3. Create another change request → should reappear
4. Sign out and back in → notification should still be dismissed
5. Approve/reject a request → should see approved/rejected notification
6. Dismiss → should disappear until new approvals/rejections

This system ensures users only see notifications for genuinely new activity while giving them full control over their notification preferences.
