# Admin Sign-Out Debugging - October 21, 2025

## What I've Done

I've added comprehensive debugging logging to track exactly what's happening when you try to access `/admin`. This will help us identify where and why the sign-out is occurring.

## Debug Logs Added

### 1. **Component Mount**
Logs when the Admin page first loads:
```
=== ADMIN PAGE MOUNTED ===
```

### 2. **Admin Verification Process**
Detailed logs throughout the verification:
```
=== ADMIN VERIFICATION START ===
[Admin] Auth state: { email, loading, isAuthed, userId }
[Admin] Current adminStatus: ...
[Admin] isClientAdmin: ...
[Admin] Getting session...
[Admin] Session result: { hasSession, hasToken, sessionError }
[Admin] Server verification request...
[Admin] Server response: { status, ok, statusText }
=== ADMIN VERIFICATION END ===
```

### 3. **Admin Status Changes**
Logs whenever isAdmin value changes:
```
[Admin] üîê isAdmin changed to: ...
```

### 4. **Auth Check Results**
Logs what UI is being rendered:
- `üö´ NO EMAIL` - No email found, checking if auth is loading
- `‚è≥ Auth loading` - Showing skeleton
- `üö´ Auth not loading but no email` - Showing "Please sign in"
- `üö´ NOT ADMIN` - Showing unauthorized message
- `‚úÖ Auth checks passed` - Rendering admin panel

## What You Need To Do

### **Step 1: Open Your Browser Console**
1. Open your browser
2. Press F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Clear any existing logs

### **Step 2: Sign In**
1. Go to your sign-in page
2. Sign in with your admin account
3. **Watch the console logs** - copy anything that shows up

### **Step 3: Try to Access Admin**
1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. **Watch the console carefully** - this is critical
3. Look for:
   - The "ADMIN PAGE MOUNTED" message
   - The "ADMIN VERIFICATION" messages
   - Any "NO EMAIL" or "NOT ADMIN" messages
   - Any error messages

### **Step 4: Copy ALL Console Logs**
**This is the most important step:**
1. Right-click in the console
2. Select "Save as..." or copy all the text
3. Send me **EVERYTHING** from the console

Look for patterns like:
- Does it say "NO EMAIL" when you have an email?
- Does verification fail?
- Does the session have a token?
- What is the `isClientAdmin` value?
- What is the server response status?

## What We're Looking For

The console logs will tell us:

1. **If auth is actually loaded** when Admin page mounts
2. **If the session/token exists** when verification runs
3. **If the server verification succeeds or fails** (and why)
4. **If isAdmin becomes true** or stays false
5. **Which auth check is failing** (no email, not admin, etc.)

## Expected Flow (Normal Case)

If everything works correctly, you should see:
```
=== ADMIN PAGE MOUNTED ===
[Admin] Initial auth state: { email: "your@email.com", loading: false, isAuthed: true }
=== ADMIN VERIFICATION START ===
[Admin] Getting session...
[Admin] Session result: { hasSession: true, hasToken: true }
[Admin] Server verification SUCCESS: { isAdmin: true }
[Admin] üîê isAdmin changed to: true
[Admin] ‚úÖ Auth checks passed - rendering admin panel
```

## Common Issues We Might Find

### Issue 1: Auth Not Loaded
```
[Admin] Initial auth state: { email: null, loading: true }
```
‚Üí Auth context is still loading when Admin page mounts

### Issue 2: No Session Token
```
[Admin] Session result: { hasSession: false, hasToken: false }
```
‚Üí Session was lost/cleared somehow

### Issue 3: Server Verification Fails
```
[Admin] Server verification FAILED: { status: 403, error: "..." }
```
‚Üí Server doesn't recognize you as admin

### Issue 4: Email Disappears
```
[Admin] üö´ NO EMAIL
[Admin] Auth state: { email: null, loading: false }
```
‚Üí Email was cleared after initial load

## Next Steps

Once you send me the console logs, I'll be able to see **exactly** what's happening and fix the real issue instead of guessing.
