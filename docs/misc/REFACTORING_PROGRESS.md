## In Progress / Next Steps 🔧

### 6. BusinessListingCard Component
**Status**: ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Reason**: The listing card is **~300+ lines** of complex JSX with:
- Header section with badges and buttons (~80 lines)
- Image gallery with mobile/desktop layouts (~150 lines)
- Business information display (~60 lines)
- Social links section (~20 lines)
- Google Calendar integration (~100 lines)

**Recommendation**: Break into sub-components first:
- `BusinessListingCardHeader.tsx` - Title, badges, action buttons
- `BusinessListingCardImages.tsx` - Image gallery with modal
- `BusinessListingCardInfo.tsx` - Business details display
- `BusinessListingCardSocial.tsx` - Social media links
- `BusinessListingCardCalendar.tsx` - Google Calendar UI
- `BusinessListingCard.tsx` - Main component that composes all sub-components

### 7. Refactor Main MyBusiness.tsx
**Status**: 🔜 NEXT

Once components are extracted, the main file should:
1. Import and use extracted components
2. Import and use custom hooks
3. Import and use utility functions
4. Reduce from 3,205 lines to ~800-1,000 lines

---

## File Size Comparison

### Before Refactoring
- `MyBusiness.tsx`: **3,205 lines** ❌ (Too large, unmaintainable)

### After Refactoring (Projected)
- `MyBusiness.tsx`: **~800-1,000 lines** ✅ (Main logic only)
- `BusinessListingForm.tsx`: **1,566 lines** 🟡 (Still large, could break down further)
- `JobPostForm.tsx`: **198 lines** ✅ (Good size)
- `PlanSelector.tsx`: **186 lines** ✅ (Good size)
- `useImageUpload.ts`: **170 lines** ✅ (Reusable logic)
- `useBusinessData.ts`: **220 lines** ✅ (Reusable logic)
- `validation.ts`: **110 lines** ✅ (Reusable utilities)
- `constants.ts`: **180 lines** ✅ (Configuration)
- `formatters.ts`: **145 lines** ✅ (Reusable utilities)

**Total**: ~3,575 lines distributed across 9 focused files ✅

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns** ✅
   - Components handle UI
   - Hooks handle state and side effects
   - Utils handle pure logic
   - Types define contracts

2. **Reusability** ✅
   - `useImageUpload` can be used in other pages
   - Validation functions can be shared
   - Formatters can be used throughout the app

3. **Maintainability** ✅
   - Each file has a single responsibility
   - Easier to find and fix bugs
   - Easier to add new features
   - Better for code reviews

4. **Testability** ✅
   - Each module can be unit tested independently
   - Validation logic can be tested without UI
   - Hooks can be tested with React Testing Library

5. **Type Safety** ✅
   - All types centralized in `types.ts`
   - No duplicate type definitions
   - Better IDE autocomplete

## Next Actions

### Option A: Continue Breaking Down (Recommended)
1. Extract BusinessListingCard sub-components
2. Refactor main MyBusiness.tsx to use all extracted pieces
3. Test thoroughly
4. Consider breaking down BusinessListingForm further

### Option B: Integrate What We Have (Faster)
1. Update MyBusiness.tsx to use extracted hooks
2. Update BusinessListingForm to use utility functions
3. Test current refactoring
4. Ship and iterate

---

## Recommendations

### For BusinessListingForm (1,566 lines)
Consider breaking into sections:
- `BasicInfoSection.tsx` (~200 lines)
- `BusinessHoursSection.tsx` (~150 lines)
- `ImageUploadSection.tsx` (~250 lines)
- `SocialLinksSection.tsx` (~100 lines)
- `RestaurantTagsSection.tsx` (~150 lines)
- `CouponSection.tsx` (~150 lines)
- `BookingSection.tsx` (~150 lines)

This would reduce BusinessListingForm to ~400 lines (just composition).

### For MyBusiness.tsx (3,205 lines)
Priority extractions:
1. ✅ Plan selection UI (done)
2. ✅ Forms (done)
3. 🔜 Business listing cards (next)
4. 🔜 Application cards
5. 🔜 Job post cards
6. 🔜 Change request cards
