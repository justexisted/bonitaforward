# Admin Sign-Out Bug - REAL FIX - October 21, 2025

## The Problem (Confirmed with Console Logs)

When you navigated to `/admin`, you were being signed out. The console logs revealed the exact issue:

### What the Logs Showed:

1. ✅ **Started with valid auth**: `email: 'justexisted@gmail.com', isAuthed: true`
2. 🔄 **Admin verification began** and made server request
3. 💥 **During `loadChangeRequests`**: Called `await supabase.auth.refreshSession()`
4. ❌ **Auth was CLEARED**: `email: undefined, isAuthed: false`
5. 🚫 **You were signed out**: "Please sign in" message appeared
6. ⏰ **Too late**: Server verification succeeded AFTER auth was already lost

### The Smoking Gun:
```
[Admin] STARTING loadChangeRequests
[Admin] ✓ Session refreshed, auth token acquired
[Admin] 🚫 NO EMAIL - Auth state: {email: undefined, loading: false, isAuthed: false}
```

## Root Cause

**`supabase.auth.refreshSession()`** was being called in three places:
- `loadChangeRequests()` - Line 379
- `loadJobPosts()` - Line 458  
- `loadBookingEvents()` - Line 510

### Why `refreshSession()` Was Wrong:

`refreshSession()` is meant to refresh an expired token, but calling it on a valid session was:
1. **Clearing the auth state** temporarily
2. **Triggering auth context updates** that propagated undefined values
3. **Causing React to re-render** with no auth
4. **Signing you out** before the refresh completed

## The Fix

Changed all three functions from:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Clears auth state
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.refreshSession()
```

To:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Gets current session without clearing it
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
```

### Files Modified:
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx`:
  - Line 377: `loadChangeRequests()` 
  - Line 458: `loadJobPosts()`
  - Line 510: `loadBookingEvents()`

## Why This Fix Works

### `getSession()` vs `refreshSession()`:

**`getSession()`**:
- ✅ Returns the current session immediately
- ✅ Doesn't modify auth state
- ✅ Non-destructive read operation
- ✅ Safe to call anytime

**`refreshSession()`**:
- ❌ Attempts to get a new token from the server
- ❌ Temporarily clears current session during refresh
- ❌ Can fail if server is slow/unavailable
- ❌ Should only be used when token is actually expired

## Testing

The debugging logs will now show:
```
[Admin] STARTING loadChangeRequests
[Admin] ✓ Session acquired, auth token obtained
[Admin] ✅ Auth checks passed - rendering admin panel
```

Instead of:
```
[Admin] ✓ Session refreshed, auth token acquired  
[Admin] 🚫 NO EMAIL - showing "Please sign in"
```

## Impact

✅ **Fixed**: Admin page no longer signs you out  
✅ **Safe**: Auth state remains stable during data loading  
✅ **Fast**: No unnecessary token refresh operations  
✅ **Reliable**: Consistent behavior across all admin functions

## Prevention

### When to Use Each Method:

**Use `getSession()`**:
- Getting current auth state
- Checking if user is logged in
- Getting token for API calls
- **99% of the time**

**Use `refreshSession()`**:
- When you get a "token expired" error
- Implementing "stay logged in" feature
- After detecting stale session
- **Rarely, and only when needed**

## Related Issues Fixed

This same bug was present in:
1. ✅ `loadChangeRequests()` - Fixed
2. ✅ `loadJobPosts()` - Fixed  
3. ✅ `loadBookingEvents()` - Fixed

All three were calling `refreshSession()` unnecessarily, any of which could have triggered the sign-out bug.
