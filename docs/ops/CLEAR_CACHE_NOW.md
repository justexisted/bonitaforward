# ⚠️ BROWSER CACHE ISSUE

## Your Problem

The fix **IS deployed** (commit `c5b5fef` is live), but your browser is showing the OLD JavaScript file (`index-C12HgcSQ.js`) which is CACHED.

## Solution: Force Clear Browser Cache

### Method 1: Hard Refresh (Try First)
1. Close ALL tabs of your site
2. Open ONE new tab
3. Go to your site
4. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + Delete** (Mac)
5. Select "Cached images and files"
6. Select "All time"
7. Click "Clear data"
8. Close browser completely
9. Reopen and try again

### Method 2: DevTools Clear (Most Reliable)
1. Open your site
2. Press **F12** (opens DevTools)
3. **Right-click the refresh button** (next to address bar)
4. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**
5. Wait for page to reload
6. Check console - you should see: `✓ Parsed using native parser`

### Method 3: Incognito/Private Mode (Quick Test)
1. Open **Incognito/Private window**: Ctrl+Shift+N (Chrome) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Firefox)
2. Go to your site
3. Try the CSV import
4. This bypasses cache completely

### Method 4: Disable Cache (For Development)
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Check **"Disable cache"** checkbox
4. Keep DevTools open
5. Refresh page
6. Try import

## How to Know It Worked

**OLD (cached) console output:**
```
Parsing date on line 2: "2025-10-07" -> cleaned: "2025-10-07"
Skipping line 2 with invalid date...
```

**NEW (fixed) console output:**
```
Parsing date on line 2: "2025-10-07" -> cleaned: "2025-10-07"
  ✓ Parsed using native parser: 2025-10-07T12:00:00.000Z
✓ Parsed line 2: Event Title
```

Look for the `✓ Parsed using native parser` message!

## Why This Happens

Browsers aggressively cache JavaScript files for performance. Even after deploying new code, your browser may serve the old cached version for hours or days until it expires.

## Nuclear Option: Clear Everything

If nothing else works:
1. Close browser completely
2. Clear ALL browser data (History, Cache, Cookies, Everything)
3. Restart computer
4. Try again

**TL;DR:** The code is fixed and deployed. You just need to clear your browser cache to see it!
