/>
```

## Admin.tsx Size Reduction

## Component Architecture

## Next Steps
**FINAL SECTION REMAINING:**
- ‚è≥ **Providers** (~1000+ lines) - THE MASSIVE ONE!

The Providers section is the largest and most complex section in Admin.tsx. It includes:
- Provider search/selection UI
- Create new provider form
- Edit provider form with many sub-sections
- Save/delete functionality
- Image management
- Booking system configuration
- And much more...

This will require careful breakdown into multiple sub-components to make it manageable.
