# Step 18: Users Section Extraction - 2025-10-19

## Summary
Successfully extracted the **Business Owners & Users** section from `Admin.tsx` into a dedicated component.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component Created
**File:** `src/components/admin/sections/UsersSection-2025-10-19.tsx`

**Features:**
- Two sub-sections in one component:
  1. **Business Owners** - profiles with `role === 'business'`
  2. **Users** - profiles with `role !== 'business'`
- Delete user functionality with confirmation
- Self-delete prevention (users can't delete themselves)
- Clean separation of business owners and regular users
- TypeScript interfaces

**Props:**
- `profiles` - Array of user profiles
- `deletingUserId` - Currently deleting user ID (for confirmation)
- `currentUserEmail` - Email of current admin user (to prevent self-deletion)
- `onSetDeletingUserId` - Set user ID for deletion confirmation
- `onDeleteUser` - Delete a user account

### 2. Admin.tsx Integration
**Changes:**
- Added import for `UsersSection`
- Replaced inline business-owners section (lines 2328-2377, ~50 lines) with the component
- Passed all necessary props to the component

**Props passed:**
```typescript
<UsersSection
  profiles={profiles}
  deletingUserId={deletingUserId}
  currentUserEmail={auth.email}
  onSetDeletingUserId={setDeletingUserId}
  onDeleteUser={deleteUser}
/>
```

## Admin.tsx Size Reduction
- **Before:** ~3,758 lines
- **After:** ~3,620 lines
- **Lines extracted:** ~50 lines

## Key Features
1. **Business Owners Section:**
   - Shows only profiles with `role === 'business'`
   - Simple delete confirmation (no special warnings)

2. **Users Section:**
   - Shows profiles with `role !== 'business'`
   - Displays user role if available
   - Prevents self-deletion (delete button disabled for current user)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Business Owners section displays correctly
- [ ] Users section displays correctly
- [ ] Delete confirmation works for business owners
- [ ] Delete confirmation works for regular users
- [ ] Self-deletion is prevented (button disabled)
- [ ] Cancel button resets delete confirmation
- [ ] User deletion completes successfully
- [ ] Empty states display correctly

## Notes
- No TypeScript errors introduced
- Component follows the same pattern as previous extractions
- All state management remains in parent (Admin.tsx)
- Props are passed down from parent
- No business logic changed, only extracted
- Combined two related sections into one component for simplicity

## Next Steps
Continue extracting remaining sections:
- ✅ Business Owners & Users (just completed)
- ⏳ Funnel Responses (~100 lines)
- ⏳ Bookings (~50 lines)
- ⏳ Booking Events (~200 lines)
- ⏳ Business Applications (~100 lines)
- ⏳ Providers (very large, ~800 lines)
