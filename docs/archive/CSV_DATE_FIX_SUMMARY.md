# CSV Date Import Fix - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Date Format Recognition ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Dates like `2025-10-07` were being rejected even though they're in the correct `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

**Root Cause:** 
- Hidden characters or extra whitespace in CSV fields
- Insufficient field cleaning during parsing
- Strict regex matching that failed on dirty data

**Solution:**
- Enhanced field cleaning with aggressive whitespace removal
- Remove all surrounding quotes and special characters
- Clean date strings by removing non-digit/separator characters
- Added detailed console logging to show exact parsing steps

### 2. Recurring/Annual Events Support ‚úÖ
**Problem:** No way to import events like "Annual Event" or "Summer 2025" that don't have specific dates.

**Solution:**
- Auto-detect recurring patterns: "Annual", "Yearly", "Summer", "Winter", "Spring", "Fall", "Ongoing"
- Assign placeholder date (2099-12-31) for database storage
- Mark with special category: "Recurring" and source: "Recurring"
- Display in separate "Annual & Recurring Events" section on calendar
- Original date text stored in description (e.g., "[Summer 2025] Event description")

## How It Works Now

### Date Parsing Flow

1. **Field Cleaning**
   ```
   Raw CSV: "  2025-10-07  "
   ‚Üí Trim whitespace: "2025-10-07"
   ‚Üí Remove quotes: 2025-10-07
   ‚Üí Clean non-digits: 2025-10-07
   ‚úì Parsed successfully
   ```

2. **Supported Date Formats**
   - `YYYY-MM-DD` ‚Üí `2025-10-07`, `2025-1-7`
   - `MM/DD/YYYY` ‚Üí `10/07/2025`, `10/7/2025`
   - `M/D/YYYY` ‚Üí `1/7/2025`
   - `M/D/YY` ‚Üí `1/7/25` (auto-converts to 20xx)

3. **Recurring Event Detection**
   ```
   Date field contains:
   - "Annual" or "Yearly" ‚Üí Recurring
   - "Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter" ‚Üí Recurring  
   - "Ongoing" or "Recurring" ‚Üí Recurring
   ```

### Console Debugging

The import now provides detailed console output:

```javascript
Processing 18 lines from CSV...
Parsing date on line 2: "2025-10-07" -> cleaned: "20251007"
  ‚úì Parsed as YYYY-MM-DD: 2025-10-07T12:00:00.000Z
‚úì Parsed line 2: Event Title

üìÖ Recurring event detected on line 19: Annual Festival (Annual Event)
‚úì Parsed line 19: Annual Festival (Recurring)

Successfully parsed 18 events
```

## Calendar Display

### Two Sections

**1. Upcoming Events** (Regular dated events)
- Sorted by vote score and date
- Shows specific dates and times
- Full voting functionality

**2. Annual & Recurring Events** (Special events)
- Separate section at bottom
- Sorted alphabetically
- Shows "[Annual Event]" or "[Summer 2025]" in description
- Full voting functionality
- Helper text: "These events happen regularly throughout the year. Check with organizers for specific dates."

## CSV Format Examples

### Regular Event
```csv
Title,Date,Time,Location,Address,Category,Description
Bonita Farmers Market,2025-10-15,09:00,Bonita Park,3215 Bonita Rd,Community,Weekly market
```

### Recurring Event
```csv
Title,Date,Time,Location,Address,Category,Description
Bonita Art Fair,Annual Event,10:00,Downtown,Main St,Arts,Annual art show
Summer Concert Series,Summer 2025,18:00,Park,Beach Rd,Entertainment,Weekly concerts
```

### Date with Commas in Description
```csv
Title,Date,Time,Location,Address,Category,Description
Food Festival,2025-10-20,11:00,Plaza,123 Main,"Food & Entertainment","Featuring tacos, pizza, and more"
```

## Testing Your CSV

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Try importing your CSV**
3. **Look for these messages:**

   ‚úÖ **Success:**
   ```
   Parsing date on line X: "2025-10-07" -> cleaned: "2025-10-07"
     ‚úì Parsed as YYYY-MM-DD: 2025-10-07T12:00:00.000Z
   ‚úì Parsed line X: Event Title
   ```

   üìÖ **Recurring Event:**
   ```
   üìÖ Recurring event detected on line X: Event Title (Annual Event)
   ‚úì Parsed line X: Event Title (Recurring)
   ```

   ‚ùå **Error:**
   ```
   Skipping line X with invalid date: "bad-date" (cleaned: "baddate")
   ```

## Common Issues Resolved

### Issue: "Skipping line with invalid date: 2025-10-07"
**Cause:** Hidden characters, BOM, or encoding issues  
**Fix:** Enhanced field cleaning removes all problematic characters

### Issue: Annual events being rejected
**Cause:** No support for non-specific dates  
**Fix:** Auto-detection and special handling for recurring events

### Issue: Descriptions with commas breaking columns
**Cause:** Naive comma splitting  
**Fix:** Proper CSV parser that handles quoted fields

### Issue: Dates in different formats
**Cause:** Only supported one format  
**Fix:** Supports YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, and variations
