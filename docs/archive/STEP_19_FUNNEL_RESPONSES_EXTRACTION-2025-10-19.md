# Step 19: Funnel Responses Section Extraction - 2025-10-19

## Summary
Successfully extracted the **Funnel Responses** section from `Admin.tsx` into a dedicated component.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component Created
**File:** `src/components/admin/sections/FunnelResponsesSection-2025-10-19.tsx`

**Features:**
- Display of funnel responses with filtering by user email
- Editable JSON textarea for answers
- Save and delete functionality
- User email filter with autocomplete datalist
- Filter status display (showing X of Y responses)
- Local state management for filter and edits

**Props:**
- `funnels` - Array of funnel response data
- `onMessage` - Callback for success messages
- `onError` - Callback for error messages
- `onFunnelsUpdate` - Callback to update funnels after deletion

**Local State:**
- `funnelUserFilter` - Email filter string
- `editFunnel` - Object tracking edited JSON per funnel ID

**Computed Values:**
- `filteredFunnels` - Memoized filtered funnel list based on user email
- `userEmails` - Memoized unique user emails for datalist

### 2. Admin.tsx Integration
**Changes:**
- Added import for `FunnelResponsesSection`
- Replaced inline funnel-responses section (lines 2338-2403, ~66 lines) with the component
- Removed unused state variables:
  - `funnelUserFilter` and `setFunnelUserFilter`
  - `editFunnel` and `setEditFunnel`
  - `filteredFunnels` memoized value
- Added comment markers for removed code (STEP 19)

**Props passed:**
```typescript
<FunnelResponsesSection
  funnels={funnels}
  onMessage={setMessage}
  onError={setError}
  onFunnelsUpdate={setFunnels}
/>
```

## Admin.tsx Size Reduction
- **Before:** ~3,620 lines
- **After:** ~3,556 lines
- **Lines extracted:** ~66 lines

## Key Features
1. **User Email Filter:**

   - Shows filtered count vs total count

2. **Funnel Response Editor:**
   - Display category and timestamp
   - Show user email
   - Editable JSON textarea (14vh height)
   - Save button to update answers
   - Delete button to remove response

3. **State Management:**

## Testing Checklist
