# Session Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all fixes made during this session.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Restaurant Scoring Logic (MAJOR FIX)

**Problem:** Featured restaurants appeared at the bottom of the list, price range filter didn't work, dietary filter was ignored, and restaurants were missing from results.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/providerScoring.ts`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Fixed price-range filter** - Changed `answers['price']` to `answers['price-range']` to match funnel question ID
2. **Added dietary filter support** - Now properly checks dietary restrictions with synonym matching
3. **Added price range synonyms** - Maps 'budget' ‚Üí '$', 'moderate' ‚Üí '$$', etc.
4. **Added dietary synonyms** - Maps filter values to common tag variations
5. **Fixed featured restaurant logic** - Featured restaurants now appear first within their score tier (not at bottom)
6. **Base score for all restaurants** - Every restaurant gets score of 1, ensuring all show (best matches score higher)

**New Scoring Weights:**
- Cuisine: +8 (exact) or +6 (synonym) - highest priority
- Occasion: +4
- Price Range: +4 (exact) or +3 (synonym)
- Service: +3
- Dietary: +3 (exact) or +2 (synonym)
- Base: +1 (everyone shows)

**Documentation:** See `RESTAURANT_SCORING_FIX.md`

### 2. ‚úÖ Featured Badge Display (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem:** Some featured restaurants weren't showing the featured star badge, while others were.

**Root Cause:** Strict boolean type checking (`=== true`) failed when PostgreSQL returned `1`, `'1'`, or `'true'` instead of boolean `true`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/helpers.ts` - Added `coerceBoolean()` helper and enhanced `isFeaturedProvider()`
- `src/services/providerService.ts` - Updated `coerceIsMember()` to use `coerceBoolean()`
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx` - Updated filters to use `isFeaturedProvider()`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Created `coerceBoolean()` helper** - Handles all PostgreSQL boolean representations
2. **Enhanced `isFeaturedProvider()`** - Works with both processed objects and raw DB records
3. **Updated provider service** - Uses shared helper for consistency
4. **Updated Admin page** - Uses shared helper instead of strict checks

**Documentation:** See `FEATURED_BADGE_FIX.md`

## Testing Checklist

### Restaurant Scoring:
- [ ] Visit `/book?category=restaurants-cafes&filters={"occasion":"casual","cuisine":"american","price-range":"budget","dietary":"none"}`
- [ ] Verify featured restaurants appear at TOP of results
- [ ] Verify price range filter affects results (budget restaurants prioritized)
- [ ] Verify dietary filter works (if set to vegetarian/vegan/etc)
- [ ] Verify all restaurants show (not filtered out completely)
- [ ] Verify "Top Matches" section shows best-matching restaurants
- [ ] Verify "Other Providers" section shows remaining restaurants

### Featured Badge:
- [ ] Visit booking page and verify ALL featured restaurants show ‚≠ê badge
- [ ] Check individual provider pages show featured badge
- [ ] Verify admin page featured filter works
- [ ] Test with restaurants that have `is_member=1` (number)
- [ ] Test with restaurants that have `is_member='true'` (string)
- [ ] Test with restaurants that have `is_member=true` (boolean)
